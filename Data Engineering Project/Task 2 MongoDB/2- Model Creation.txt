Model Creation:
To structure the data for training a predictive model to forecast future orders based on historical data,
we need to identify the features (given variables) and the target variable (predicitve variables).

Exisitng Features - To be used columns
1- order_id
2- customer_id
3- shipment_date
4- product_id
5- order_date
6- quantity
7- unit_price

Target Variables - Predictive Columns
The target can be related to future orders which may include:
1- Total quantity of products ordered in the next month.
2- Total revenue generated from orders in the next month.
3- Total number of orders placed in the next month.

Data Preprocessing
1-Some other columns can also be integrated into the data such as product category which
categorizes the data into some categories beacuse it will help us in predicting what kind of
product has been sold in the future i.e. creating additional features
2- Converting categorical variables into numeric representations using encoding techniques.

Model Training
1- Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
2- We can employ different machine learning techniques in order to train the data using
linear regression, decision trees and random forest etc.
